This is an automatic programmer for STC MCU with a few interesting
enhancement compared to the "STC Auto Programmer" available on 
AliExpress:

- Added a RESET push button to allow for manual power cycling of
the target MCU.

- Added a slide switch to select the target MCU's supply voltage.

- Added a Schottky diode on TxD to prevent parasite powering of 
the target MCU.

- Used a USB B socket instead of a USB A plug so the programmer
can be placed further away from the computer, and to leave room
to connect other USB devices on adjacent USB ports of the computer.

This programmer uses a CH340N, which only has RTS# (no DTR#), so
you'll need to use stcgal-patched's -A rts option in addition to
-a to automatically power cycle the target MCU.

Using a CH340N has the added benefit that it makes it possible to 
use the same adapter for programming and UART debugging: DTR is 
asserted low when opening a serial port, which annoyingly powers 
off the target board. Using RTS doesn't present this issue.
