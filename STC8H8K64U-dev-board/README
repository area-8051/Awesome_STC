A nice development board equiped with the STC8H8K64U can be found on
AliExpress around EUR 10-15 from these stores:

The technical reference manual of the STC8H family can be downloaded 
here: https://www.stcmcudata.com/STC8F-datasheet/STC8H-en.pdf

The seller can provide you with the board's schematic as a PDF file, 
but with annotations in Mandarin Chinese. I have translated them into 
English for convenience (STC8H_schematic_v1.3.pdf).

In addition, I have created 2 files to describe the main components on 
the board and its jumpers (components+jumpers.pdf), and the functions 
of its connectors and switches (connectors+switches.pdf).

I have no rights on the schematic itself, but my translation work and 
the 2 additional PDF files are Copyright (c) 2022 Vincent DEFERT and

I wish you long hours of happy hacking with your STC8H8K64U board! :)
