This directory contains information about STC's MCU's documentation 
in order to facilitate a few common tasks:

1. Finding the difference between the Chinese and English versions of
the technical reference manuals (the English version somewhat lags 
behind the Chinese version).

=> *-revision-gap-between-cn-en.txt

2. Finding information about silicon bugs.

=> *-silicon-errata.txt

3. Determining the differences between 2 MCU series.

=> *-migration-guide.txt

WARNINGS

- These files are quick translations made with Google Translate, meaning
they are quite perfectible.

- The original documentation also has bugs, hence the revisions.

- I've done them for my own use, and shared them in case other fellow 
embedded developers would find them useful too.

- For these reasons, use at your own risk.
