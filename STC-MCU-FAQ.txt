-- Why should I use STC's MCU? -----------------------------------------

Provided you compare apples to apples, i.e. STC's MCU to other 
MCS-51 MCU:

- They are cheap.
- They have easy to use peripherals.
- They are well documented.
- They can be used with open source tools.
- They don't require a proprietary programmer.

These charachteristics are certainly not unique, but their combination
constitutes a kind of least resistance path in the MCS-51 world.

-- Which programmer should I buy? --------------------------------------

An USB-to-TTL adapter is enough to flash an STC MCU.

However, as the flashing procedure involves power cycling the MCU,
you may want to buy an "STC Auto Programmer" from AliExpress for 
a couple of dollars to make it even easier.

Read the Using_an_STC_Auto_Programmer_with_STCGAL document in this
repository for more information.

-- Which STC MCU should I use? -----------------------------------------

As a general rule, always prefer the STC8H series.

If you need USB, or a lot of RAM, use the STC8H8K64U.

Otherwise, you'll find the STC8H1K08T/STC8H1K17T and the STC8H4 series 
are very good choices in most situations.

For very cost-sensitive applications, the STC8H series are still the 
best choice, as older series are more expensive. However, you might
want to use less capable STC8H MCU to slightly reduce cost.

Finally, if you need an 8-pin package, use the STC8G1K08A/STC8G1K17A.

-- Which toolchain should I use? ---------------------------------------

SDCC includes a C compiler, an assembler and a linker.

Other than this, you'll just need the up-to-date version of STCGAL
to program your MCU: https://github.com/area-8051/stcgal-patched

-- Where can I find code examples? -------------------------------------

Here is a HAL providing consistent use of STC's MCU features across
their most recent series: https://github.com/area-8051/uni-STC

This repository includes demos to illustrate the use of the HAL, but
the HAL's source code can be used as a live documentation on the use 
of STC's MCU.

-- What are the differences between the STC8H8K64U and the STC8A8K64D4?

They are almost identical:

 Features |   STC8H8K64U    | STC8A8K64D4
----------+-----------------+----------------
   PCA    | No              | Yes
   PWM    | Advanced 16-bit | Enhanced 15-bit
   USB    | Yes             | No
   RTC    | Yes             | No
